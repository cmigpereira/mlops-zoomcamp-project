# Setup AWS and MLFlow

You need an AWS account for this project. 
The setup of the account is outside of the scope of this, but you can always look for the AWS Free Tier (Free Trials, 12 months free, Always Free).

Follow the instructions in the [Course Notes](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-experiment-tracking/mlflow_on_aws.md) for setting up AWS and MLFlow.
